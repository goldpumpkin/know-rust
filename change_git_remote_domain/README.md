## Change Git Remote Domain for Multiple Repositories

This Rust program automates the process of changing the remote domain for multiple Git repositories within a specified directory. It iterates through each subdirectory in the given directory, identifies Git repositories, and updates the remote URLs by replacing the old domain with a new domain.

### Usage

1. Specify the directory path containing the Git repositories by modifying the `dir_path` variable in the `main` function:

   ```rust
   let dir_path = "/path/to/doc";
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/doc` with the actual path to the directory where your Git repositories are located.

2. Update the `update_remote_domain` function to implement your logic for replacing the old domain with the new domain in the remote URLs:

   ```rust
   fn update_remote_domain(remote_url: &str) -> String {
       // Replace this with your logic to update the remote domain
       // For example, you can use regex to replace the domain part of the URL
       remote_url.replace("old.domain.com", "new.domain.com")
   }
   ```

   In the provided example, it assumes that the old domain is `old.domain.com`, and it needs to be replaced with `new.domain.com`. You should modify this function to match your specific requirements.

3. Build and run the Rust program.

### How It Works

1. The program starts by creating a `Path` object representing the specified directory path.

2. It then iterates over all subdirectories within the specified directory.

3. For each subdirectory that contains a `.git` directory (indicating a Git repository), the program performs the following steps:

   a. Retrieves the current remote URLs for the repository using the `git remote -v` command.

   b. For each remote URL, it calls the `update_remote_domain` function to update the domain part of the URL.

   c. If the new remote URL is different from the old one, it updates the remote URL using the `git remote set-url` command.

4. The program prints the updated remote URLs and any errors encountered during the process.

### Dependencies

- This program assumes that you have Git installed and available in your system's `PATH`.
- It uses the standard Rust libraries (`std::env`, `std::path`, and `std::process`).

Note: Make sure to replace the `update_remote_domain` function with your own logic to update the remote domain based on your requirements.
